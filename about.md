Ph.D interested on quantum chemistry, namely method development. I am 
highly interested on analytical and efficient methods that that provides accurate 
results for the legitimate reason. Lately, I have been properly focused in 
photocatalysts and multireference electron correlation methods.

Youthful Linux enthusiast since 2009, and I do not see myself intentionally 
using something else than [arch linux][arh linux]. My dot files are available for anyone 
who wish to willingly give a try, but remember, [vim][vim] is a modern pandora's box.
