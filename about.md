Ph.D student interested on quantum chemistry, namely method development. I am highly 
interested on analitical methods that that provide accurate results for the right reason. 
Lately I have been focused in photocatalysts and multireference electron correlation methods. 

Linux enthusiast since 2009, and I do not see myself using something else than
[arh linux]. My dot files are available for anyone who wish to give a try, but 
remember [vim] is a modern pandora`s box.
