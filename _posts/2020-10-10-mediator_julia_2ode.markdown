Some months ago an acquintance of mine asked me whether in **Julia** it would be possible to solve second order differential equations (ODE). That person was trying to solve it in **Python**, using the standard approach, *i.e.* solving two first ODE. This person was obtaining close, but strange results. The reason was the its system of equations were coupple, therefore, in order to solve the second ODEs as multiple first ODEs, first it has to uncouple the equations.

I was confident that using softwares like maple or mathematica one could uncouple the equations. Highly likely the same could be done in mere python using *sympy*. Nevertheless, I was curious whether it could be done in **Julia**. It was something that I never tried, thus, I wanted to see it myself. Short answer, **YES**, it is possible. The best part is that, I do not need to uncouple the equations. The package [OrdinaryDiffEq][1ODE]  intristicly does all the heavy lifting for you.

The second ODE to solve are found in [this paper][paper], namely the system of equation 2.1 and 2.2. At the moment of writing this "*article*", **Julia 1.5.2** the lastest available version. Here I shall only highlight the most important steps as variables and tuning of the plots depends on one taste.

1. Open julia and load the needed packages. In my case, the bare necesasry. 
{% highlight julia %}
using OrdinaryDiffEq, Plots
{% endhighlight %}

2. Include the constants that you need to use. I highly recomend to use `const` beforre the constant varian, if you are sure it will not change diring the calculation. In principle this should help to speed up the calculation.
{% highlight julia %}
const m_1 = 1.0
const g   = 9.81
tfinal = 130.0
{% endhighlight %}

3. This is a good point to write the initial conditions of the system of the equations.
{% highlight julia %}
du0 = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
u0 = [pi/2.4, pi/2.4, 0.0 ]
{% endhighlight %}

4. Put the **Julia** function with the system of equations to solve. Here `p` used to put variables that you might need to change in the equation, for example, chage the value of an angle. 
{% highlight julia %}
function synch_pendulus(ddu, du, u, p, t)
    ddu[1] =  -(m_1*ddu[3]*l*cos(u[1]) + c_vdp*du[1]*(1-zeta*(u[1]^2)) +
              m_1*g*l*sin(u[1]))/(m_1*l^2)
    ddu[2] =  -(m_2*ddu[3]*l*cos(u[2]) + c_vdp*du[2]*(1-zeta*(u[2]^2)) +
              m_2*g*l*sin(u[2]))/(m_2*l^2)
    ddu[3] =  -(c_x*du[3] + k_x*u[3] + m_1*l*(ddu[1]*cos(u[1])
                                           - (du[1]^2)*sin(u[1])) +
              m_2*l*(ddu[2]*cos(u[2])-(du[2]^2)*sin(u[2])))/(M+m_1+m_2)
{% endhighlight %}

5. Pass the solver. Here one indicates that the eqation to solve is a second ODE with certain initial parameters.
{% highlight julia %}
prob = SecondOrderODEProblem(synch_pendulus, du0, u0, tspan)
{% endhighlight %}

6. Solve the second ODE. In this case I am using a Runge-Kutta-Nystr√∂m integrator, but one could experience bettter results using other. Feel free to experiment with it. 
{% highlight julia %}
sol = solve(prob, DPRKN6(), reltol=1e-12, abstol=1e-12, maxiters=1e10)
{% endhighlight %}

The only thing that is left is to plot the results. Particularly, I like using **latex**-**pfg** style, if you like it too, then you need to install the package `PGFPlotsX`, because that is the backend used by `Plots`.


This is the result. Just one of the many plots that could be created.

Hope this helps you.
