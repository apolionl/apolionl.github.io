This weekend while I was reading the highlights in the journal Nature, I found
an interesting publication that let me thinking till this moment. The
publication is [**Revealed: the millions of dollars in time wasted making papers fit journal guidelines**][pap1].

> There’s a clamour (for reform) on Twitter. Every week there’s stuff going on about formats and submission. People do want them to be liberalized (because) it’s a waste of time.

This article caught my attention because for almost 6 years I have been using
**Latex**. My change from standard MS Office to **Latex** originates from the
extensive editing I had to perform to the references. I began to hate the long
editing of paper of reports, thus I change that could save me time, which
**Latex** does.

Back to the article. Students, teachers, and everyone involved in the craft of
scientific publications suffer from adjusting the manuscript to the journal format after a first editorial desk rejection.
In this publication authors estimated the time and costs of adjusting manuscripts
to journals formatting style in the resubmission. Reader must be aware that most journals have specific
formats for manuscript submissions. Although, is practically standard to have
an introduction, methods, results, and conclusions framework, some journals like
Nature or Science have a different standard. In fact, this is [one of the main
conclusions of the paper][pap2], namely journals have a huge diversity in
submission requirements. From the authors' estimation, just in the [European Union
and the USA 230 million USD were lost in 2021][pap2].

![2000 - 2030 expenses on manuscript formatting.][pic2]

The study estimates that if the trend continues for the rest of the decade,
in the next 8 years (the study finished in 2022) the expenses in manuscript
reformatting after a first editorial desk rejection sum 2.5 billion USD.
When I see that amount, it is impossible to avoid thinking in those research
project that could be founded.

I invite the reader to check the paper for details. One of the major
conclusion and solutions to the reformatting issue is to have a unique manuscript
submission style, thus independent where the draft is submitted, one can use
a standard style. Meanwhile, I believe that the only solution that partially
solves the issue is to use **Latex**. Most journals have **Latex** templates. By
using those one can save time -a lot of time.

> Just send (the article) in to us, and we’ll take a look at it. And if we like it, we’ll send it out for peer review. And if it meets peer review, we’ll send it back to you. And **THEN** you can put it into our journal’s format. I think that’s respectful of the authors’ time and effort.
